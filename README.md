/asteroids

There are two groups of asteroids near Jupiter that orbit close to the the Lagrange points L4 and L5 of the Sun-Jupiter sytem. This project contains code that was used to study the stability of these asteroids to displacements from the Lagrange points. In addition a real-time, multithreaded simulation was created, the output of which can be seen in the two gif files. The main classes are stored in SolarSystemRotatingFrame.py and the simulation in simulation.py.
